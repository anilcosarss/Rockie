####  One of the simple projecst that I liked desing and try to make (no looking any code!) , this project was completed using HTML , CSS and my purpose in making this project was to experience basic HTML CSS features .  <br>  <br>  <br>

My achievements were:
- Creating a static website
- Flexbox
- Positions
- Different hover effects
- Creating navbar and main HTML attributes
- Aminations
- Responsive Desing ( There are some problems with media queries because of it was one of the project between my first projects)
